Different character art styles matter a lot when you draw your characters. It defines the shape, the silhouette, the way it’s going to be perceived by your audience. Choosing the proper style for your characters that suits your project from the start will result in a beautiful blend of artistic integrity, connection with other aspects of your game and overall a unified artistic touch. 

Let’s take a look at video game art styles, what makes particular character styles stand differently, explore several possible ways game developers use their character design art styles and see some references in popular videogames.

## Basic principles of character design art styles

Here are several principles of character design style that are very important to keep in mind as you work on it:

1. **The silhouette is important:**

    Not only does it define the way your characters look as a whole, but it also allows you to recognize their shapes among others, from a distance or when it’s too overcrowded on the screen. Try not to make it too complex, yet do your best to make it truly distinct.
2. **Color palette defines the mood:**

   Colors always allow you to express characters’ subtle aspects of their personality, draw attention and make them simply look great. Experiment a bit considering your style’s limitations and see which color palette suits your characters the best. 
3. **Expressions, poses and gestures define the personality:**

   What kind of kinetic energy do your characters possess? It can be defined by their body language, so try to make readable poses and gestures that still manage to feel unique for a particular character. A superhero will be confident, a common citizen will probably be scared, an enemy will have a menacing pose and so on.
4. **Choose between either simplicity or details:**

   Keep in mind that simplicity doesn’t always mean bad, and animating and implementing simplistic characters is going to be much easier from a long-term perspective. At the same time, do not settle on simplicity if you think your characters benefit from a rich amount of detail that helps you to tell their stories efficiently.
5. **Storytelling matters:**

   Speaking of stories, do not forget that you’re telling your audience a story with your characters’ looks. Sometimes you don’t have to say, but you can only show a detail that will be better than a thousand words. Think of Joel’s broken wristwatch in 

   *The Last of Us*

   or Harry Potter’s scar. Their design is a part of a whole backstory. Do not hesitate to incorporate stuff like this. 
6. **Keep things consistent:**

   Be sure to maintain consistency across the character and within the art style. All designs must correlate with each other, the art style should follow the key aspects to be considered by your audience as a whole.

## Most popular character design art styles

And now let’s look at some of the most frequently used video game art styles and see what makes them distinct. We will also check out the screenshots of recent and not-so-recent games for each style.

### Pixel style

The pixelated style for character and game design gained popularity in the early 00s among video games – it was easier to do for small indie teams and in addition, it brought back childhood memories of fun and wonder developers and players of that generation experienced while playing games on their consoles. 

Quickly, pixel style has become a cherished style thanks to that: it quickly established itself as a style that is heavily associated with the indie scene. Nowadays, new generations of players prefer the nostalgic and impressionistic quality of low-poly, but pixel style is still here for those who have an emotional connection to it that is hard to put into words. It’s also very straightforward on a technical level: pixel-style color pallets tend to be limited, designs usually follow particular, blocky shapes, animations are simple. Some artists, however, can go forward and put a lot of effort into pixel style, making it look less than a game from your childhood and more like a real painting.

**Perfect for you if:** You’re making a game with a retro aesthetic, don’t have a bigger budget for more demanding 2D and 3D styles or just like how special and unique it still manages to look.

**Examples:** 

* *Animal Well (2024)*
* *Hotline Miami (2012)*
* *The Unliving (2023)*

In 2023, we released our very own game in a pixelated style called **The Unliving.** It’s a rogue-lite set in a fantasy world, which allows players to build up a great undead army and reach great heights.

## Realistic style

The realistic style rewards your audience with an incredibly immersive experience, but it’s among the most challenging styles to do. It requires you to follow a lot of strict rules our world imposes on us. Human anatomy, physics, natural depictions of our humane aspects – it’s pretty hard to pin it down. Meticulous modeling, tricky animation, complicated structures require artists to work hard to make sure the final result will feel as organic as technologically possible. 

In addition, due to an infamous uncanny valley effect, it takes a lot to make character design art styles look AND feel nice, not like a deadly robot merely pretending to be a human and waiting for a moment to attack. The good news is that artists have developed various techniques to make realistic characters feel more alive than ever. That’s why there are a lot of projects that utilize this particular style successfully and produce a lot of critically acclaimed work. 

**Perfect for you if**: You are making a game for mass audiences of players and the story you’re going to tell requires a realistic approach for character design styles. 

**Examples:**

* Naughty Dog’s modern titles (

  *Uncharted and The Last of Us* series) 
* *Call of Duty and Battlefield* series
* *The Witcher 3* (2015)



## Conclusion

Your character’s style defines the visual code of the project and creates associations your audience will make, so it’s very important to choose the style that suits everything in your game: from story to gameplay. Creating memorable, unique characters is important if you’re planning to create a resonating game that will haunt your players for years and will be fondly remembered.
